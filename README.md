# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
> The purpose of our new analysis is to summarize dataframe by city type. By displaying the different city types, such as Urban, Rural and Suburban we can generate multiple graphs to show several results. One of our main purposes is to exhibit the weekly fares by city types in a line graph. In order to accomplish this task we used the following functions: GroupBy, Count, and Sum. Just to name a few. 
### Results:
>
•	As we can see from the image below the urban city types had a substantial more of total drivers, fares, and rides then rural and suburban.

•	The rural city types had the least amount of rides, fares, and drivers.

•	In the middle is suburban city type.

•	Furthermore, with the urban city type having more drivers and rides, there charges for fare per ride and per driver was a lower amount then the other two city types.  In results having the most total fares.

### Summary and Recommendations
>Based off the data analysis we have a better picture to build our future results. We can see the urban city type over seeded with all three aspects. As a result we can further established the other two city types to provide the same results. Increases or decreases the fares based off data analysis can help to distribute the revenue. Increase the fares for both the rural and suburban areas.
