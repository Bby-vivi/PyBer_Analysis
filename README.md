# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
> The purpose of our new analysis is to summarize dataframe by city type. By displaying the different city types, such as Urban, Rural and Suburban we can generate multiple graphs to show several results. One of our main purposes is to exhibit the weekly fares by city types in a line graph. In order to accomplish this task we used the following functions: GroupBy, Count, and Sum is just a few to name. 

### Results:
